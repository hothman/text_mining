TI  - Diffusion regulated growth characteristics of a spherical prevascular carcinoma.
PG  - 549-82
AB  - Recently a mathematical model of the prevascular phases of tumor growth by
      diffusion has been investigated (S.A. Maggelakis and J.A. Adam, Math. Comput.
      Modeling, in press). In this paper we examine in detail the results and
      implications of that mathematical model, particularly in the light of recent
      experimental work carried out on multicellular spheroids. The overall growth
      characteristics are determined in the present model by four parameters: Q, gamma,
      b, and delta, which depend on information about inhibitor production rates,
      oxygen consumption rates, volume loss and cell proliferation rates, and measures 
      of the degree of non-uniformity of the various diffusion processes that take
      place. The integro-differential growth equation is solved for the outer spheroid 
      radius R0(t) and three related inner radii subject to the solution of the
      governing time-independent diffusion equations (under conditions of diffusive
      equilibrium) and the appropriate boundary conditions. Hopefully, future
      experimental work will enable reasonable bounds to be placed on parameter values 
      referred to in this model: meanwhile, specific experimentally-provided initial
      data can be used to predict subsequent growth characteristics of in vitro
      multicellular spheroids. This will be one objective of future studies.

TI  - A deterministic model of the cell cycle.
PG  - 535-47
AB  - The variability of the duration of the cell cycle is explained by the phenomenon 
      of sensitive dependence upon initial conditions; as may occur in deterministic
      non-linear systems. Chaotic dynamics of a system is the result of this sensitive 
      dependence. First a deterministic system is formulated that is equivalent to the 
      Smith-Martin transition probability model of the cell cycle. Next the model is
      extended to a dynamic process that ranges over the cell generations. A
      deterministic non-linear relationship between the cycle time of the mother and
      daughter cell is established. It clarifies the variability of mother-daughter
      correlation for the different cell types. The model is fitted to two different
      cell cultures; it shows that the graph of the non-linear relation has the same
      shape for different cell types.

TI  - Minimum message length encoding and the comparison of macromolecules.
PG  - 431-53
AB  - A comparison of inductive inference known as minimum message length encoding is
      applied to string comparison in molecular biology. The question of whether or not
      two strings are related and, if so, of how they are related and the problem of
      finding a good theory of string mutation are treated as inductive inference
      problems. The method allows the posterior odds-ratio of two string alignments or 
      of two models of string mutation to be computed. The connection between models of
      mutation and existing string alignment algorithms is made explicit. A fast
      minimum message length alignment algorithm is also described.
